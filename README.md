# Prowly-recruitment-task
Project Overview

This repository contains test cases created as part of a recruitment task. The goal of the task was to design and document test scenarios for searching specific keywords on search engines (Bing and Google) with various filters. The tests are written in Gherkin syntax, making them readable and easy to update for both manual and automated testing.

Features

Scenario 1: Searching for the word "semrush" on Bing.com, filtered by content categories such as:
- Copilot
- Images
- Videos
  
Scenario 2: Searching for the word "prowly" on Google.com, filtered by date ranges such as:
- Past hour
- Past day
- Past week

Test cases for Bing and Google can be found in the test_cases/features folder.
